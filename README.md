# Data-Cleaning
I analysed and cleaned a Nashville Housing dataset using PostgreSQL 15. 

I cleaned up the date column and changed the data type to the appropriate one, populated empty columns utilising the join statement, separated the address column into address, city and state, altered and updated the table and a lot more.
